One function of an operating system is storing memory.  For applications to work on a computer they must be stored within a computer's memory.  When the user requests the application to be used, the computer quickly converts the applications data to RAM for the user to begin giving the application tasks.  While the user has the application open the operating system is responsible for using RAM to communicate the applications code over to a more friendly user interface.  Most operating systems allow the user to run multiple applications at once thus, increasing productivity.
Another function of the operating system is my favorite--turning the computer on and off!  When the user pushes the on button an electrical signa is sent to a chip in the computers mother board that kicks on the electricity.  Once the computer is powered up the operating system can then start doing tasks.  The operating system will look for corrupted files or bugs.  This is why it can sometimes take a while for a user's computer to fully reboot if it has been completely turned off.
The operating system also manages which tasks are completed first.  When printing the operating system knows to pull the files from whatever memory medium the user requests.  It then knows to briefly store them as ram and communicate with the printer to carry out the final task.
