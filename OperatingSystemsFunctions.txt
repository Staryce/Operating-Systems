One function of an operating system is storing memory.  For applications to work on a computer they must be stored within a computer's memory.  When the user requests the application to be used, the computer quickly converts the applications data to RAM for the user to begin giving the application tasks.  While the user has the application open the operating system is responsible for using RAM to communicate the applications code over to a more friendly user interface.  Most operating systems allow the user to run multiple applications at once thus, increasing productivity.
